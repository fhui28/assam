`assam` is an R package associated with the manuscript "Approximate and scalable finite mixture models for clustering species environmental responses in ecology" by [Hui](https://francishui.netlify.app/), [Menendez](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/1043920-patricia-menendez-galvan), [Foster](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=WPRiGeYAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Woolley](https://people.csiro.au/W/S/Skip-Woolley), which is currently in preparation/review. Such model-based clustering of species according to their environmental responses, into a small number of so-called "archetypal responses" is also known in ecology as species archetype models, after [Dunstan et al., (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2010.11.030), [Dunstan et al., (2013)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13253-013-0146-x) and [Hui et al., (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1890/12-1322.1).
